# ROB-BigBrother
The main deliverable in the course Robotics in winter semester 2015/2016. The program runs visual tracking of the user defined area (preferably one's head) and moves the hardware manipulator (P&amp;T unit) with the camera mounted on so that the tracked object would still be visible (intersecting the optical axis).
